# MZA: mass-to-charge (m/z) generic data storage and access tool

PeakDecoder is a machine learning-based metabolite identification algorithm for multidimensional mass spectrometry measurements incorporating liquid chromatography (LC) and ion mobility spectrometry (IM) separations, and collecting extensive fragmentation spectra with data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods. The algorithm learns to distinguish true co-elution and co-mobility from raw data and calculates metabolite identification error rates.

### Data

The 3 subfolder contain input and output files to run the PeakDecoder steps for the synthetic biology datasets:
* Asper: *Aspergillus pseudoterreus* and *Aspergillus niger* strains
* Pput: *Pseudomonas putida* strains
* Rhodo: *Rhodosporidium toruloides* strains
